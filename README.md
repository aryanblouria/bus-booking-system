## Abstract

<li> The travel industry is a booming business across the globe and is evolving every day. With evolution arises the need for digitizing all transactions. The bus reservation system is an easyto-use online bus ticket booking system. It manages reservation of buses, along with
schedules and details of each bus, while also maintaining a record of passenger details as well as seat availability.</li>

<li>On studying the existing bus reservation systems in use, we made an inference regarding their shortcomings that can be improved upon and propose an enhanced version of the same systems. By carefully analyzing the prevailing situation, we identified the problem areas to have a clear idea about a desirable outcome.</li>

<li>Using this system, we will be able to easily book tickets for buses online from the comfort ofour homes, helping customers to organize work trips and daily commute easily while efficiently processing bookings and making payments. </li>
